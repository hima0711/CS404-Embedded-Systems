Debian always has at least three releases in active maintenance: "Stable", "Testing" and "Unstable".

Stable:-
	Latest Version: Jessie (Debian 8).
        The current stable distribution of Debian is version 8, codenamed jessie. It was initially released as version 8 on April 25th, 2015 		and its latest update, version 8.2, was released on September 5th, 2015.

Testing:- 
	Latest version: Stretch.
        The testing distribution contains packages that haven't been accepted into a stable release yet, but they are in the queue for that. 	The main advantage of using this distribution is that it has more recent versions of software.

Unstable:-
	Latest version: Sid
        The unstable distribution is where active development of Debian occurs. Generally, this distribution is run by developers and those 		who like to live on the edge
